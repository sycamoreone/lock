Lock
=====

Lock is an implementation of the github.com/kaepora/miniLock encrypted container format.
It comes without a user interface and is still missing most of the features in minilock.

Disclaimer
---------

This is proof-of-concept quality code at best and it should be assumed that nobody but the author ever looked at it.
Please  use the official miniLock plugin, if you are looking for a secure encryption software.
